	<div><p1> Here are some things about me as a person. I am a chill person that can sit down and listen to someone. Though, I am not much of a talker at first, if you get to know me, then I will be talking more comfortably and open up more. I am also very simple thinking at times. I will look at a problem and try to simplify it as much as I can for easier explanation.</p1><br>
	<p2> Some other things about me are that I am usually a sleepy person. Meaning that I will start sleeping or take a nap. That is usually due to my life style of staying up very late then waking up really early. Sometimes it is also due to stress from school or personal problems. I also like eating or just having good food. Good food always helps a bad day or just relieves hunger. I also need to wear glass for reading if I can remember.</p2></div><br>
