	<h1>Welcome To Computer Science 1</h1><br>
	<p>Hello there! Welcome to the website that I created in the computer science 1 class at SMASH. This may look like it took some easy buttons to press and create but there is actually a lot more to it. The files that we are using are HTML, and CSS. Soon we may start using a little bit of JavaScipt but I don't think that we will have enough time for that. Either way, this took some time to create and the visitor internet here at Stanford is not very good.</p><br>
	<p>Now a bit about the class. It is fun at times but also a lot of work if you don't keep up with the lesson. Although, it also depends if the actual material will take a lot of time to understand. I also was able to create this website with a program called Sublime. It is very helpful with making up the rest of the text for the program names. Like the navs, h1s, and body stuff. I also have to type this as an exit ticket of some sort and this website just needs more stuff.</p>
